One of the critical functions that we provide for our clients is the ability to pay for their employees’ benefits packages.  A portion of these costs are deducted from their paycheck, and we handle that deduction.  Please demonstrate how you would code the following scenario:

•	The cost of benefits is $1000/year for each employee
•	Each dependent (children and possibly spouses) incurs a cost of $500/year
•	Anyone whose name starts with ‘A’ gets a 10% discount, employee or dependent

We’d like to see this calculation used in a web application where employers input employees and their dependents, and get a preview of the costs.

Assumptions:
•	All employees are paid $2000 per paycheck before deductions
•	There are 26 paychecks in a year
